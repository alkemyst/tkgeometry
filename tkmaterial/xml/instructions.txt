Tested for CMSSW_2_2_6

IGUANA:

Given a CMSSW workspace and environment:
1. Check out Geometry/CMSCommonData/python and 
Geometry/TrackerCommonData/data from the CMSSW repository to your 
workspace (CMSSW_x_x_x/src).

2. Rename the file Geometry/CMSCommonData/python/cmsIdealGeometryXML_cfi.py to 
back it up.

3. Copy the altered file cmsIdealGeometryXML_cfi.py provided in this 
folder ([somepath]/tkgeometry/tkmaterial/xml/) to 
CMSSW_x_x_x/src/Geometry/CMSCommonData/python to replace the renamed 
.py file.

4. Rename the file Geometry/TrackerCommonData/data/tracker.xml to back 
it up.

5. Run tkmaterial with 3 config files and the -x option: 
./tkmaterial geometryfile settingsfile materialfile -x [outname]
from directory [somepath]/tkgeometry/tkmaterial

6. Go to xml/[outname] or xml/[geometryfile_without_extension], 
depending on whether you specified a name for the output subfolder or 
not.

7. Copy the file tracker.xml to 
[anotherpath]/CMSSW_x_x_x/src/Geometry/TrackerCommonData/data/ to 
replace the renamed .xml file.

8. If necessary, copy the file xml/geometry_cfg.py to a directory within 
your workspace.

9. If necessary, set up the environment by running cmsenv.

10. Switch to the directory containing the file geometry_cfg.py and 
start Iguana with it (iguana geometry_cfg.py) to display the result.

CMSSW:

The -x option of tkmaterial produces five different files: tracker.xml,
trackersens.xml, trackerProdCuts.xml, trackerStructureTopology.xml and
trackerRecoMaterial.xml

1) tracker.xml and trackerStructureTopology.xml replace existing files
in [anotherpath]/CMSSW_x_x_x/src/Geometry/TrackerCommonData/data/ - make
sure to back the original up first. It may be necessary to copy those
blocks describing the pixel detector from the original to the replacement.

2) Back up copies of the original trackersens.xml and trackerProdCuts.xml
(both in [anotherpath]/CMSSW_x_x_x/src/Geometry/TrackerSimData/data/).
Replace the blocks describing tracker barrel properties in those two files.
If there are endcaps in the new geometry, replace those blocks as well.
If not, delete the blocks describing tracker endcaps.

3) Back up a copy of the original trackerRecoMaterial.xml
(in [anotherpath]/CMSSW_x_x_x/src/Geometry/TrackerRecoData/data/).
As in 2), replace all blocks describing tracker barrel properties and
delete those describing tracker endcaps.

4) Comment out all lines related to the TIB and TEC in those .py
files that load XML resources. Comment out the TID lines as well if
the geometry does not have endcaps at all.
