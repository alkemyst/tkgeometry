Resources directory:

This directory should conains one subdirectory per geometry.
Each subdirectory will contain the following files:

- a configuration file called 'default.cfg'
- a plaintext description called 'desc.txt'
- a diagram of the geometry called 'layout.png'

The file structure should look like this when starting from the tkgeometry base directory (for a geometry called Pippo):
res/Pippo/default.cfg
res/Pippo/desc.txt
res/Pippo/layout.png
