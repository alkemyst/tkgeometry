#summary Quick-start guide to download and compile tklayout rev. 664 or greater on lxplus machines.

= Quick start recipe =

NOTE: this quick start recipe details the procedure for compiling and running tkLayout revision 664 or greater on *lxplus* machines with *64-bit SLC5*.

Some thinkering with library paths, environment variables and/or Makefile options might be needed to successfully compile tkLayout on other architectures/operating systems.

tkLayout requires:
 * ROOT version > 5.28.00
 * BOOST version > 1.41
 * gcc version > 4.2



# All the necessary libraries and compiler versions are already installed on lxplus machines running 64-bit SLC5, thus after logging on, like this:

 `> ssh lx64slc5.cern.ch`

# Then, you just need to source the following scripts to setup an appropriate environment:

 `> source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/contrib/gcc/4.3/x86_64-slc5/setup.sh`
 
 `> source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/5.34.00/x86_64-slc5-gcc43-dbg/root/bin/thisroot.sh`


# Then, proceed to the checkout of the code:

 `> svn checkout http://tkgeometry.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tkgeometry

 `> cd tkgeometry`

# Then, check your compiler version by running: 
 
 `> gcc -v`

# If gcc version is < 4.7, please edit the file Makefile and comment out the following two lines:

  `COMPILERFLAGS+=-Wno-narrowing`

  `COMPILERFLAGS+=-Wno-delete-non-virtual-dtor`

So that they look like this:

  `#COMPILERFLAGS+=-Wno-narrowing`

  `#COMPILERFLAGS+=-Wno-delete-non-virtual-dtor`


# You can finally compile and install tkLayout with the following command:

  `> make clean && make -j4 && make install`


# Once built, you can run:

  `> tklayout --help`
