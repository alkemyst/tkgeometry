#summary Quick-start guide to download and compile tklayout rev. 856 or greater on lxplus machines.

= Quick start recipe =

*NOTE*: this quick start recipe details the procedure for compiling and running tkLayout revision 856 or greater on *lxplus machines with 64-bit SLC6*.

Some tinkering with library paths, environment variables and/or Makefile options might be needed to successfully compile tkLayout on other architectures/operating systems.

tkLayout requires:
 * ROOT version > 5.34.09
 * BOOST version > 1.55
 * gcc version > 4.7



*1.* All the necessary libraries and compiler versions are already installed on lxplus machines running 64-bit SLC6, thus after logging on, like this:

<code>
ssh lxplus6.cern.ch</code>

*2.* Then, you just need to source the following scripts and to set the following variables to setup an appropriate environment:

<code>
source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/5.34.09/x86_64-slc6-gcc47-dbg/root/bin/thisroot.sh
source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/contrib/gcc/4.7/x86_64-slc6-gcc47-opt/setup.sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/Boost/1.55.0_python2.7/x86_64-slc6-gcc47-opt/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export BOOST_LIB=/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/Boost/1.55.0_python2.7/x86_64-slc6-gcc47-opt/lib
export BOOST_INCLUDE=/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/Boost/1.55.0_python2.7/x86_64-slc6-gcc47-opt/include/boost-1_55
export BOOST_SUFFIX=-gcc47-mt-1_55
</code>
You can also put those commands on a script and launch the script on startup (i.e. calling it in .bashrc)

*3.* Then, proceed to the checkout of the code:

<code>
svn checkout http://tkgeometry.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tkgeometry
cd tkgeometry</code>

*4.* Then, check your compiler version by running: 
 
<code language="bash">
gcc -v</code>

*5.* If gcc version is < 4.7, please edit the file Makefile and comment out the following two lines:
<code>
COMPILERFLAGS+=-Wno-narrowing
COMPILERFLAGS+=-Wno-delete-non-virtual-dtor</code>

So that they look like this:
<code>
#COMPILERFLAGS+=-Wno-narrowing
#COMPILERFLAGS+=-Wno-delete-non-virtual-dtor</code>


*6.* You can finally compile and install tkLayout with the following command:
<code>
make clean && make -j4 && make install</code>

*7.* The install process will ask some questions, namely: where to copy the executable, where to store the html output and where to store the "standard output" (xml and some configuration files).
Pay attention to specify *different paths for them than the source code path*, lest the installer fail.

tkLayout stores the installation configuration in the file "~/.tkgeometryrc", so that in case wrong data is entered, one can remove the file and rerun "make install".


*8.* Once tklayout is built and installed, you can see the command line options with:
<code>
tklayout --help</code>
